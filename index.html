        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The question of whether Ghegs (from the northern region of Albania) are more connected to the ancient Illyrians than Tosks (from the southern region) is one that has intrigued historians, anthropologists, and Albanians alike. The roots of this debate lie in the cultural, linguistic, and geographical differences between these two groups, as well as their historical connection to the ancient Illyrians.
        </p>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            The Illyrians were a group of tribes that inhabited the western Balkans, including the region that is now Albania. Their influence can be seen in both the northern and southern parts of the country, but many believe that the Ghegs have retained a stronger link to the ancient Illyrian civilization due to their geographical location and historical isolation in the northern mountains.
        </p>

        <h2>Geographical Differences</h2>
        <p>
            The Ghegs traditionally lived in the northern part of Albania, which is mountainous and difficult to access. This isolation is often cited as a factor that allowed Ghegs to preserve more of their Illyrian heritage, including their language and traditions. In contrast, the Tosks have been more influenced by neighboring Greek and Roman cultures due to their location in the southern part of Albania, which is closer to the Mediterranean.
        </p>

        <h2>Linguistic Evidence</h2>
        <p>
            One of the key aspects of this debate is the linguistic differences between the Ghegs and Tosks. The Gheg dialect is often considered more archaic and closer to the language spoken by the Illyrians. While the Tosk dialect has undergone more changes, the Gheg dialect retains some elements that are thought to be closer to the ancient Illyrian language.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            While it is difficult to definitively say whether Ghegs are more Illyrians than Tosks, it is clear that the northern Albanians have a stronger historical and cultural connection to the ancient Illyrians. Their geographical isolation and preserved traditions make them an important link to Albania's Illyrian past.
